# Lowest Common Ancestor Part 2



  - Improved implementation to work with DAG's
  - Originally developed on DAG branch
  - DAG branch merged back into normal branch after completion
  - Added additional tests to check whether or not the algorithm handles DAG's correctly (which is does)
  - tests against acyclical, cyclical, and various other types of graphs designed to throw errors.
